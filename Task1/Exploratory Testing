**Exploratory Testing**

The given webpage (https://www.phptravels.net/) didn't work as expected at all. Search hotels section was totaly out of work never gives me a result. 
I was searching a hotel for booking(tried it 6 days and each day several times) but all time the was giving 'No Results Found' message.  Only a few times after searching I could see some hotel names and whenever I would like to book a stay I always see "No rooms available, please try another date" message.
I attached link of my screen records for different times so you can also see the results.


The Webpage does not work as expected for that reason, I could not  pass and see any further step to do exploratory testing. On Thursday, I asked ismael.guindo@wefox.com  who  had sent the task to me about problem I have faced, but he said this what I should see while testing because there are bugs in that webpage.

Task 1 is the one that consumed most of my time while doind this assesment however I did not get any result because of the bug in the hotel search function.
 
 I hope you take consideration much more in task 2 and task 3 answers.
