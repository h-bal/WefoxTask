This is a maven project. All necessary dependencies was added(Testng assertion,restassured library)

Java language(version 8) and OOP concept(Encapsulation,Inheritence,Abstraction) has been used.

Build up with TestNG framework.

Page Object Model design pattern has been used.(Configuration properties,Configuration readers,pages,Utilities)

Pom.xml is brain of our project I put all kind of dependencies and libraries needed.
Configuration Properties is a central for saving all necesary data(url,browser,credentials)
Utilities folder has Browser Utils and Configuration Readers class.

I used Swagger documentation for execute my automaion test cases. 
But before each automation testing I did that particular test manually in my postman to see expected results.

I did my Api testing with POJO by using serialization.
